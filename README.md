# TheXTech Windows RT

SMBX engine, rewritten into C++ from VisualBasic 6.

-----------


## What is this?
This is a direct continuation of the SMBX 1.3 engine. Originally it was written in VB6 for Windows, and later, it got ported/rewritten into C++ and became a cross-platform engine. It completely reproduces the old SMBX 1.3 engine (aside from its Editor), includes many of its logical bugs (critical bugs that lead the game to crash or freeze got fixed), and also adds a lot of new updates and features.

## ARM32 Port for Windows RT
This fork of TheXTech has been slightly modified to be able to be compiled for windows arm32 devices like the microsoft surface rt.

## How do I run this
You need a device like the Surface RT that either runs Windows RT or Windows 10 arm32.
Make sure you have installed vc_redist.arm.exe.
A jailbreak is required in order to run unsigned exe files.
